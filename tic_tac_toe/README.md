# Tic Tac Toe CLI Game (Dart)

## Gameplay Instructions

- The game board is a 3x3 grid numbered from 1 to 9, representing each cell.
- Players take turns entering their moves by selecting a cell number.
- The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their mark ('X' or 'O') wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
